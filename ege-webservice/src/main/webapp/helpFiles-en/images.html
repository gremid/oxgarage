	<h2>Help: Upload Images</h2>

	<p>When you upload an XML document with links to images located on your computer, please upload the images. You can select the image files directly, or you can select a zip file containing all the relevant images. If you have in your document also links to images on the internet, these will be downloaded and included with your document, unless you state otherwise in the advanced options.</p>
